严肃主题的电影与娱乐电影
Serious movies are films that teach us lessons about life. 
Watching this kind of movies brings people the chance to learn more from daily life. 
However, entertaining movies mostly only make people relax. So I agree with the topic.

学生对老师的评价比老师间互评更有效
Agree
1. students：Firstly, stuedent is more relible to judge, because they know teachers' performance in class
2. teachers: Secoudly, evaluation between teachers may cause competition, which is not good for them to improve.

远亲关系没有以前紧密了
Diagree
1. our: Extended family is still the most important people that we can rely on when facing trouble.
2. social: Truly, we have less communication with extended faily than before. But they are our most close relations amount the sociality.

空闲时间陪孩子玩还是学习
School Work
1. children: Firstly, it is important for children to get learning method, which parents can teach them
2. family: Secondly, doing school work related thing makes parent know more about childrens' study.
3. parent: 
Truly, parents need to relax during free time, they may want to play with children. 
But teaching childrens, which have much less pressure than work, is a better way of relaxing. 
Because it can raise their spirit due to the love and care of childrens. 
Further more, it can strengthen parent-child relationship since parents can gain childrens' confusion in study and help them directly, which weights more.
